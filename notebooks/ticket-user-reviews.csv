We traveled from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap by Seila Angkor van. The driver was professional and it was a smooth ride. It took us only 5 hours to get to Siem Reap (including one short stay at gas station and lunch break at Kompong Thom for 30 minutes).,5,2016-08-14 04:01:37 UTC,Seila Angkor Khmer Express

Driver is so rude,2.8,2022-03-18 01:16:35 UTC,Kim Seng Express
We arrived on time which was great because I didn't have to seat on small narrow seats any longer. I don't know how a normally build person can seat there for so many hours. And the beeping of speedometer was getting annoying after 6 hours,3.4,2022-03-18 03:56:35 UTC,Larryta Bus
The van was really old and worn down. A normal size person can not seat normally on those chairs (even the locals had problem). Will not choose this company again. ,2,2022-03-18 03:58:45 UTC,Ekareach Express
